            <p>We believe in transparent development. Here's a glimpse of what's coming next:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: Enhanced Player Experience</strong> - Improving inventory management and character customization.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2 & 3: Realistic Physics Engine</strong> - Introducing gravity, collisions for objects, and player physics for deeper immersion.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 4: Advanced Player Interactions</strong> - Implementing player-to-player collision management.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 5: A Richer World</strong> - Adding NPCs, quests, and direct player-to-player trading.</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Vision:</strong> A world-building tool for non-developers and migration to a more robust database.</li>

        <section id="about">
            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p>World RPG started as a passion project to create a lightweight, self-hostable MMORPG experience. It's built on the idea that players should have true ownership of their game worlds. Whether you're an indie developer looking for a foundation, a teacher creating an interactive lesson, or a group of friends wanting a private LAN adventure, this project is for you.</p>
            <p>We are open-source and community-driven. Your feedback and contributions can help shape the future of this ever-evolving universe.</p>
